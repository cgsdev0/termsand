## how do i use it

this thing is designed to work with tmux 3.4+

1. `cargo install --git https://github.com/cgsdev0/termsand`
2. download [`sand.sh`](https://github.com/cgsdev0/termsand/blob/main/sand.sh) to somewhere
3. bind it to a key in your `tmux.conf` like this:
```
bind-key e run-shell "./sand.sh"
```

and then maybe it will work

good luck have fun
